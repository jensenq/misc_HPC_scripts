Notes for table 10:

  This table shows total wall clock time for the ranks with the
    maximum, mean, and minimum time, as well as the average across
    ranks.
    It also shows maximum memory usage from /proc/self/numa_maps for
    those ranks, and on average.  The usage is total size of all
    pages, including huge pages, that were actually mapped into
    physical memory from both private and shared memory segments.

General table notes:

    The default notes for a table is do not account for the effects
    of additional command-line options, but the detailed notes
    produced by the -v option do account for them.
    
    An imbalance metric in a line is based on values in main threads
    across multiple ranks, or on values across all threads, as applicable.
    
    An imbalance percent in a line is relative to the maximum value
    for that line across ranks or threads, as applicable.
